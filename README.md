# Xllusive DDoS Tool

![Banner](banner.png)

## Overview

**Xllusive DDoS Tool** is a powerful educational tool designed to simulate a stress test (DDoS simulation) on a target URL. With a simple graphical user interface (GUI), the tool provides a highly interactive and immersive experience, complete with simulated "hacking" sequences and background animations. This tool is designed for ethical use only‚Äîalways get proper authorization before conducting any stress tests.

**Important Note:**  
**Unauthorized use of this tool is illegal.** Only perform DDoS simulations on systems that you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Features

- **üñ•Ô∏è Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
  The tool features an intuitive GUI built using **Tkinter** for easy operation.

- **üéÆ Real-Time Hacking Simulation**  
  Enjoy an immersive experience with a scrolling "hacking" code and animated background GIF to simulate a cyber attack.

- **üîê User Authentication**  
  A password prompt ensures that only authorized users can start the stress test.

- **‚ö° Stress Test Configuration**  
  You can specify the target URL and the number of threads to control the intensity of the attack.

- **üõë Stop Test Option**  
  A button to stop the test anytime.

Start the Stress Test

Once authenticated, click the Start Attack button to begin the stress test.
During the attack, you will see a scrolling code simulation, and the sound will play in the background.
Stop the Stress Test

To stop the test, click the Stop Attack button.
Usage Example
Start the Program
The GUI window will open with the following layout:

Start Attack button to initiate the stress test.
Stop Attack button to stop the test once started.
Text area that shows the status and attack simulation.
Interactive Screen
Upon starting the attack, you‚Äôll see real-time code simulation running on the screen. The background will feature a hacker GIF, and you will hear the hacking sound through your speakers.

Caution
‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Warning:
Only use this tool in a controlled environment or on systems you have explicit permission to stress test. Performing unauthorized DDoS attacks is illegal and unethical.

‚ö†Ô∏è System Resource Usage:
Be cautious with the number of threads you specify. A large number of threads can cause your system to become unresponsive. Start with a low number of threads and gradually increase as needed.

‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Considerations:
This tool is intended to be used for educational purposes, penetration testing with consent, or within controlled environments for learning.
